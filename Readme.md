# friggeri-website

This is a template for a website to go with a resume created with the [friggeri-cv resume template](http://www.latextemplates.com/template/friggeri-resume-cv).

## The website

After using the friggeri CV LaTeX template I decided it should be doable to use the same design on a website, using just HTML and CSS, which allows for a consistent design for the resume, cover letter (as made by Matthew Davis) and website.
